Student Well-being-Companionship-Robot
The global pandemic has extremely affected the wellbeing of children. From having lockdown measures and reduced human to human contact has left children feeling lonely. Research has shown that quarantine measures of isolation can lead to long term psychological consequences of their wellbeing.This means having someone/something they feel close to and comforted by.

The purpose of this project is to create a wellbeing companion robot for primary school pupils to be used during the COVID-19 pandemic. It will focus on the aspect of:

Emotional expression To be able to provide a companionship and engagement activity with pupils by giving a simple feedback in terms of some facial emotion such as Happiness, sadness, angry, surprised or shocked and Neutral extraction.

Age recognition

• To be able to interact with different children of different primary school age.

Face recognition

• To be able to recognise different facial expressions to provide a response, enabling non-verbal communication.

Object recognition

• To be able to recognise different objects for the better understanding of things that surrounds it.

Other features of the robot include telling jokes and body expressions to interact with a pupil to brighten up their day and be friends. The end goal of this companion robot is to ensure that the child does not feel lonely since they have a robotic friend.

Operation System and Programming Language
Threre are different tools for different levels of users. The tutorials in this repository will mainly forcus on Non-developers and Beginner developers.

Non-developers
For non-developers there is the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) Choreographe. It’s a desktop application that allows you to control Nao using a simple drag and drop interface, including:

Create animations, behaviors and dialogs
Test them on a simulated robot or directly on a real one
Monitor and control your robot
Beginner developers
People with rudimentary programming skills can write Python code and add it to Choreographe.

Expert developers
Expert developers can choose from - C++, Python, MatLab and many more through their SDK’s.
